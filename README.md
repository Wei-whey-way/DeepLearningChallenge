# DeepLearningChallenge

# **Animal Competition**
Use of the Animal dataset (https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/cZYtNAeVhWD6uBX). This dataset contains images of 151 different animals.

The dataset contains a total of 6270 images corresponding to the name of animal types.

All images are RGB images of 224 pixels wide by 224 pixels high in .jpg format. The images are separated in 151 folders according to their respective class.

The task is to categorize each animal into one of 151 categories.

The code involves:
*   Loading and Analysing the dataset using torchvision.
*   Defining a simple convolutional neural network.
*   How to use existing loss function for the model learning.
*   Train the network on the training data.
*   Test the trained network on the testing data.
